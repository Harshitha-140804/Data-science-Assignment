# Data Science Assignment

This repository contains my submissions for the Zeotap internship assignment. The project includes tasks related to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Lookalike modeling, and Clustering analysis. Below is an overview of the files and their purposes.

## Repository Structure

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **`Harshitha_N_EDA.pdf`**: Detailed report of the EDA process and insights.
- **`Harshitha_N_EDA.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for EDA.

### 2. Lookalike Modeling
- **`Harshitha_N_Lookalike.csv`**: Dataset used for Lookalike modeling.
- **`Harshitha_N_Lookalike.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook with the implementation of the Lookalike modeling task.

### 3. Clustering Analysis
